#Finite State Machines

An introduction to finite state machines (fsm).

FSM and grammars are two equivalent ways of representing a set of strings accepted by a given language. 

The union of deterministic finite machines (DFM) and nondeterministic finite machines (NFM) make the set of all FSM. FSMs are a subset of turning machines and can not be used to represent all languages turning machines can represent.

All Nondeterministic finite machines can be converted to deterministic finite machines. Given a NFM create a DFM in which each state represents a set of possible states the NFM could be in, for the corresponding state transition.

All FSM can be represented as a regular expression.
